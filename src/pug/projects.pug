            p I used to run a vanilla Minecraft server with a few friends. When we realized we needed a website to garner more attention, I took it upon myself to create one. I could have just used some Wordpress template, but I had a specific idea of how I wanted it to look that only custom code could create.
            p This website was the result. It was the first website I ever built and was hand coded in html, css, and php. I'm proud of the design, although my color selection could have been a bit better. The code isn't very pretty, but it get's the job done.
            p.last The server is still running today. I gave the domain away to a few dedicated staff. They have since updated the website to a <a href="https://github.com/flarum/flarum">Flarum</a> template. If you play Minecraft, pay them a visit. Tell them ThunderBird21 sent you.
