	<h2>Dream Log</h2>
	<h3>2016-9-6</h3>
	<p>Last night I had 3 dreams that I recalled clearly with an estimated total of 8 dreams.</p>
	<h4>AP Chem Makeup</h4>
	<p>
		This dream had to do with anxiety surrounding school. It seems I had signed up for an AP Chemistry course that I had forgotten to attend and do homework for. Ms. Basil (HS Chem Teacher) was teaching the course and seemed disappointed that I had forgotten about the class. Isaac was also in the dream. Isaac (HS Friend) and the group was there and I had some anxiety being around them. Part of the dream took place in Ms. Basil's classroom and part in an underground cement basement type area.
	</p>
	<h4>Nick Schizo</h4>
	<p>
		I can't recall much from this dream anymore but I remember having a very personal conversation with my brother, Nick. He rarely opens up, so it was really insightful to get his input on his own schizophrenia.
	</p>
	<h4>Hotel Donuts & Bruce</h4>
	<p>
		This dream was rather complex and very visually vivid. I remember it taking place mostly in this hotel like complex. The complex shared some features with other dreams I've had in the past. It was multi-story and laid out almost in the same way as my neighborhood(?). Part of the dream I was rollerblading around the complex and talking with strangers. In another part of it, I was talking with Bruce (Step-Grandfather) and eating donuts with him. I had some anxiety about not talking   to him in a while. The dream ended with me in my room looking out my window at some floating sticker objects with my mom.
